# AI-Based Dyslexia Detection Tool (Ongoing)

## Overview  
This AI tool detects dyslexia by analyzing reading ability using Web Speech APIs. It identifies challenges with confusing letters and words, assesses reading fluency and comprehension, enabling early diagnosis to support timely intervention and personalized learning assistance.

## Features  
- Speech recognition to analyze reading patterns  
- Identification of commonly confused letters and words  
- Assessment of reading fluency and comprehension levels  
- Early dyslexia detection to aid educators and parents  

## Tech Stack  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Speech Processing: Web Speech API  
- Backend: Python (Flask/Django - optional, based on your setup)  
- Machine Learning: (Add your ML framework here if used, e.g., TensorFlow, Scikit-learn)  

## Project Status  
This project is currently **ongoing** and under active development. Features and functionalities are continuously being improved.
